# GTX-CS1332-DSA
Required Coursework for GaTech OMSCS

Work with common data structures used in software development by coding their low-level implementation 
- Arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists (Singular, Doubly, Circular) Stacks, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues 
- Various Trees: Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Splay, Heaps, 2-4 Trees, etc… 
- Hash Maps/Tables; External Chaining and Probing Graphs and their algorithms 

Become familiar with common algorithms on these data structures 
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Cocktail Shaker, Merge, Quick, Radix etc... 
- Pattern Matching Algorithms: Brute force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, Rabin-Karp
- Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and multiple MSTs
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Work with Big-O notation, allowing good choices about the appropriate data structure and algorithm to use for a particular programming problem

Improve one's ability to test and debug programs
